# Feign Client Implementations

As described by [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/intro-to-feign), Feign is a declarative HTTP client developed by
Netflix. Feign aims at simplifying HTTP API clients. Simply put, the developer needs only to declare and annotate an
interface while the actual implementation will be provisioned at runtime.
See [Open Feign](https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign).
